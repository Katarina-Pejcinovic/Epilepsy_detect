This explains how to read in a cnn model for validation 

There is a file called simple_cnn_model.pth in the github. This is an instance of 
the model created when you run run_cnn() function in cnn.py. You can laod this 
model with model.load_state_dict(torch.load('simple_cnn_model.pth')), where you replace 
model with whatever the variable name is of the call of run_cnn(). For eaxmple, 

model = run_CNN(multichannel_data, labels)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('simple_cnn_model.pth'))
