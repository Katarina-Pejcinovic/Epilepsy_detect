# Epilepsy_detection
Pipeline that takes in EEG signals and outputs the optimal machine learning method for epilepsy detection

## Beta Version:
- Run in batch execution
- Run with a directory of data (subset of overall data set that will be used)
- FULL PIPELINE NEEDS TO RUN
- Output result table with info on how the pipeline worked (quality of results not important yet)
- Remove any hard coded sections
- Good comments
- TESTING SCRIPTS
- Documentation -> more to the format of our final paper
